CALCULATE ERROR PER CLASS FROM unprocessed_class_analysis and processed_class_analysis.

Notes:
Total:  caught:
2178 - 2091: 4% error (100 - (2091*100/2178))
1177 - 1144: 3% error
975 - 943: 4% error
867 - 832: 4% error
762 - 730: 4% error
456 - 440: 5% error
869 - 830: 4% error
430 - 418: 3% error
374 - 354: 5% error
342 - 324: 5% error
312 - 293: 6% error
280 - 264: 6% error
267 - 260: 3% error
246 - 237: 4% error
179 - 173: 3% error
242 - 230: 5% error
160 - 152: 5% error
65 - 63: 4% error
AVG: 4.1% error

To inform on the lower bound of classes - number of classes needs to be above the error rate by at least a margin that fixes that error: if 10% error rate, then need 100 for the class. The absolute error is the difference between the state of nature, in this case full sentence labels and the word segmentation labels. The absolute error is then taken as a percentage of the total amount of data points per class caught in the full sentence labels. Below 10 data points per class, we take the error to be 0. This is further substantiated by manually checking random samples of the segmented words and the automatically associated label. This means that all classes are free to be used in the analysis.
