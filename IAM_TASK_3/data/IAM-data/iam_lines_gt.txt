In the train going back to London I sat

down to visit my young friend Philip

For his sake we chose the more

I had to explain the low, sharp and

The cool evening perfumes stood

It was growing cold. We left the

day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been

of our arrival it was throwing huge over-ripe verbal

One called La Patriote is Communist, and at the time

Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family

r06-044-02.png
throttled to death by his wife, children and

paper and the superintendent of police,

r06-044-01.png
Monsieur H, for instance, had been clubbed and

informing them that he was on the point

They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses.

r06-137-00.png
The doorman turned his attention

r06-137-04.png
of the cruelty of the world. Finally Catherine

r06-137-05.png
said, her eyes wet again: 'I think its all

r06-137-06.png
absolutely beastly, and I can't bear to think

r06-137-07.png
about it.' And Philip said: 'But we've got

r06-137-01.png
to the next red-eyed emerger from the

the station, the children silent because

r06-137-08.png
to think about it, don't you see, because

r06-137-02.png
dark; and we went on together to

if we don't it'll just go on and on, don't

you see?'

expressed, but Monsieur V (this was

Monsieur V's house was immediately

r06-049-08.png
actually reported in the next issue) returned

surrounded by firemen and other officials,

fifty years afterwards when so many

g04-092-04.png
allowed to come to the Children's Church

It was quite amusing to see how much

old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well

g04-026-04.png
teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by

the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women

continuing till old age to-day. When I went

a table with cross and candles, and the people

This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went

We also had a little Mission Hall leading off

g04-055-03.png
there, but was soon changed into the better-

scorned these more simple country folk.

This may be bought at any good timber merchants.

The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply

e04-062-05.png
wood of the same make, or oak or mahogany. For the

e04-062-06.png
last one I made, I used the two flaps from an old

inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the

See Fig. 2. These are then glued and

the other. If care is taken not to waste the

e04-099-03.png
lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this

e04-099-00.png
Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the

e04-099-01.png
plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for

e04-099-04.png
purpose, the sides from one, and the bottom from

e04-099-02.png
planing after fixing to the boat. Use your two

e04-034-06.png
for the seat and the back which can be decorated with

e04-034-00.png
Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes

e04-034-05.png
a suitable pastel shade, using a contrasting colour

e04-034-03.png
edge of the seat, feeding tray, etc). Fill the grain with a

e04-034-01.png

framework and round off any sharp edges (such as the

e04-034-04.png

which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat

on each side.

ash, spruce or any long grained flexible wood. I

e04-086-05.png
in the plan, the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.

e04-086-02.png
cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak,

e04-086-00.png
The chine is the long stringer on each side which

e04-132-04.png
article.

e04-132-02.png
also be arranged into a design, and the

e04-132-03.png

While these may ultimately be made into a picture

e04-132-01.png
for framing and hanging on a wall, they may

e04-083-06.png
the hull is under construction.

e04-083-00.png
The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to

e04-083-04.png
notches, as they are not fastened to the

e04-083-05.png
moulds, which will only be used whilst

e04-083-02.png
Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould

e04-083-03.png
to allow for the chines to rest in these

e04-083-01.png
correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat.

e04-109-00.png
Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws (brass) or nail

e04-109-02.png
you are doing it that way. Use flat head screws

e04-109-05.png
the screw to allow for a good grip. Remember

e04-109-04.png
the 1/4 in. ply. Make a very small hole for

e04-109-01.png
with inch and a quarter galvanized nails, if

e04-109-06.png
to glue before screwing.

e04-109-03.png
about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in

e04-114-04.png
necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with

e04-114-00.png
Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom,

e04-114-01.png
which is cut in one piece. It should overlap just a

e04-114-05.png
the screws. I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for

e04-114-03.png
screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is

e04-114-07.png
the bottom shaped transom facing.

e04-114-06.png
the bottom, both for screwing to the chines and

e04-114-02.png
trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are

e04-119-03.png
shift them right out of the way. Place the boat right side

e04-119-01.png
the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off

e04-119-05.png
working.

e04-119-00.png
Again, don't forget to glue. Now put on the keel and

e04-119-04.png
up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for

e04-119-02.png
the moulds. You won't want them again for this boat, so

e04-127-04.png
WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut

e04-127-00.png
I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull

e04-127-05.png

defence of the Polaris missile base. And by

a04-050-01.png
not deny facilities to nations to which it was

a04-050-00.png
Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could

a04-050-04.png
agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because,

a04-050-06.png
would attract enemy action.

a04-050-03.png
and refuse proposals with which they did not

a04-050-05.png
he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and

a04-050-02.png
allied. But governments should be free to negotiate

a04-047-07.png
their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on

a04-047-01.png
of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt

a04-047-08.png
to the missile.

a04-047-02.png
sure the Labour movement was coming round in

a04-047-06.png
supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing

Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that

Addressing the annual congress of the National Union

a04-047-03.png
support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and

a04-047-04.png
widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in

recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear

a04-066-01.png
unilateralists was not possible, though

that "those who organise these things" were

to the official document on to opposition

a04-066-00.png
Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the

he respected their views. He saw by reports

disarmament to shift the emphasis of

a04-066-08.png
to the Polaris base.

a04-103-04.png
growing body of opinion in this country

a04-103-05.png
believes that Britain could be more effective

a04-103-06.png
in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral

a04-103-00.png
The third reason is that the supreme

interest for the whole world - East and

a04-103-02.png
West and uncommitted nations - is the

a04-103-07.png
by helping to suggest agreements which could

prevention of nuclear war. "A rapidly

as there is a Polaris base in Britain the

a04-096-06.png
there is a distinct possibility that so long

a04-096-03.png
impossible for the British authorities to

a04-096-09.png
Britain alone.

a04-096-00.png
The second reason is concerned with doubts

a04-096-04.png
exercise any degree of control over the action

a04-096-02.png
"in the time of crisis it would probably be

regrettable, that the agitation against

There are three kinds of reasons that justify

first of these reasons is the importance of pre-

the Polaris base has generated some antagonism

It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is

The press and the broadcasting authorities are

In any case, fahrenheit need not lose heart.

b03-114-07.png
that the well-meaning corporation

Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable. They should not,

was only joking." "Well, don't. It's

p03-112-00.png
"No, it wouldn't!" he almost snapped,

p03-112-01.png
surprising her. "You sounded like some-

p03-121-02.png
a strictly stag affair." "I know. I didn't expect ..." "Well,

p03-121-06.png
three weeks, etcetera, etcetera!"

p03-121-01.png
at this time of year? I can't ask you up because it's

I'm going with a shooting party. What else can I do

can't imagine the hospital without me for

isn't as bad as an operation, Nigel!"

p03-142-03.png
will we?" "No," he eyed her strangely. "I wish we

p03-142-05.png
was over." Again her laughter trilled. "Marriage

make all the waiting worth while. When we're

p03-142-02.png
married we won't have these explosions of emotion,

"Darling!" her voiced caressed him. "Moments like this

p03-142-04.png

out to him, still playfully. Without a glimmer

p03-158-07.png
told her.

p03-103-04.png
wish I could go with you!" "Doctor

p03-103-07.png
I suppose?" she enquired archly.

p03-103-01.png
couldn't believe it. Self-deprecation

p03-103-06.png
"It would make me more interesting,

p03-103-00.png
I'm such a dull fellow, really." "Dull?" She

Wills, if you're making improper suggestions ...?"

"You need your holiday, darling. I only

"If I were a tramp I would simply blow a

p03-135-02.png
regard first. "I would mind if you didn't" he told her

p03-135-00.png
Her figure was small and exquisite, like a schoolgirl's still, and

p03-135-04.png
right, pet. I do need this leave. I'm bad-tempered and

thoughts. At one time she had

p03-004-04.png
watched the workmen constructing

p03-004-01.png
new seat outside the hospital

least. She would think of her-

p03-004-06.png
to put St. John's Casualty Department

p03-096-09.png
two-timing Don Juan.

p03-096-08.png
the housemen think of me as a

p03-096-02.png
particular surgery?" "You are a fool,

p03-096-07.png
kissing her again. "I rather like to have

p03-096-04.png
great pleasure in telling that young man

p03-096-03.png
darling," Di said happily. "I shall take

p03-096-00.png
"My white or my black?" Nigel enquired.

p03-096-01.png
"Now I wonder which I wore at that

p03-096-05.png
exactly what you were doing that

p03-069-04.png
"Nigel," she had besought him, "you know that evening

p03-069-06.png
with a cyst on her ear ... ?"

p03-069-05.png
you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman

p03-069-03.png
made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead.

p03-069-01.png
realised it was important enough for her to have remembered, and it

p03-069-00.png
But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had

p03-069-02.png
was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and

p03-185-06.png
Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention,

p03-185-04.png
from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-

p03-185-00.png
Thus had they parted the previous evening and now

p03-185-08.png
to be met at the gates.

p03-185-03.png
doctor would be free during the day; tea was served

p03-185-07.png
she was convinced, or he would have granted her small request

p03-185-05.png
room, which proved the elasticity of medical commitments.

p03-185-01.png
Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital

p03-185-02.png
alone. Of course one couldn't say for certain when a

p03-151-04.png
looming ... ? "Are we discussing a marriage

p03-151-02.png
that particular problem isn't looming at

p03-151-03.png
the moment, thank God!" Problem ... ?

p03-151-00.png
"Isn't it?" he rose and smoothed himself

p03-151-06.png
he could be serious. "Surely marrying

p03-151-05.png
or a burial?" she asked, hardly believing

p03-151-07.png
me isn't going to be all that bad?

p03-151-01.png
down. "Ask any bridegroom-to-be. Anyhow,

p03-057-04.png
That blonde was something." "Anybody

p03-057-02.png
"I remember," quipped the houseman,

p03-057-09.png
all important."

p03-057-05.png
I know?" she smiled. "I think so.

p03-057-08.png
"No," Di said immediately. "It isn't at

p03-057-01.png
"He's saving up to get married. Remember?"

p03-057-00.png
"Neither can Nigel," smiled Diana.

p03-057-03.png
meaning no offence, "but does he?

p03-057-07.png
wasn't there it isn't important, is it?"

p03-057-06.png
I got a good look at her. But if Nigel

p03-087-00.png
"Oh, he wasn't. His motor-bike had

p03-087-03.png
this blonde." "Really?" Nigel cocked

p03-087-02.png
your car and then you dancing with

p03-087-08.png
"He didn't actually see you. Because

p03-087-07.png
you this, too?" "No," she laughed.

p03-087-06.png

as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as "a

their tribal reserves with no prospect but a

b01-113-02.png
policy of good neighbourliness." We may be sure that

b01-084-01.png
made. India has responded handsomely by providing

If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground,

That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold

as a means to curb rising prices at home. She is

b01-044-02.png
also aware how # unpopular she has been growing

For upwards of five years the world's reserves of

There is a possibility that it will not be

b01-073-03.png
to say that its 400 troops in the Congo

Certainly, the rise is very small. But it is a step

it would also be against the interests of the

b01-009-00.png
The Archbishop has long been a courageous

b01-009-04.png
South Africa, weakening the whites who are

b01-009-07.png
Africans.

b01-127-03.png
what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries

b01-127-00.png
The views of the Archbishop, who has

b01-127-08.png
apartheid is being applied ever more

b01-127-09.png
ruthlessly.

b01-127-02.png
Christianity really means, must carry weight. But

maintained an unflinching witness to what

actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary,

responsibility rightly belongs to the nations

Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to

b01-079-06.png

waiting for the millenium, however, most of us

Those who lend their names to this kind of

would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in

that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning

b01-014-01.png
Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth

b01-014-08.png
the apartheid policy.

b01-014-03.png
On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, inclu-

b01-014-06.png
Verwoerd and the Nationalists. They point out

b01-014-04.png

b01-014-05.png
shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.

Seen in this wider picture, a South Africa that clings to

b01-023-03.png
solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft

But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by

last impertinent remark. "With four other people -"

made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless

to sort things out in her mind. That beneath his

n02-016-00.png
"Oh, she was due!" And then he added in the same

n02-098-00.png
She wavered, and at last said

n02-098-01.png
slowly, "If you must drag the truth

n02-098-04.png
don't tell me anything, if you'd rather

n02-098-05.png
not." He was clearly startled by her

n02-098-02.png
out of me, I must ask you to regard

it as confidential." "My dear Beryl,

in her quivering flesh. "You've an answer - of sorts - for everything," she

along." To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses

And so they prefer objective methods. Since they cannot

person they observe his visible behaviour and then try

of the doctor who observes signs, and records symptoms,

f01-143-03.png
to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind

f01-143-06.png
and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them.

f01-070-03.png
with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed

f01-070-06.png
gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its

f01-070-00.png
Can we now put forward any reasonably clear

f01-070-01.png
picture of this "basis" of mental phenomena?

f01-070-08.png
of mind akin to the atoms of matter?

f01-070-07.png
theories of "mind"? Are there any ultimate units

f01-070-05.png
as chemical action, magnetism, the behaviour of

f01-070-04.png
picture of the basis of such material phenomena

f01-070-02.png
The physicists have succeeded remarkably well,

f01-058-03.png
a well-established learner and the world

f01-058-07.png
logists, many of whom would like to

f01-058-09.png
of us obstinately go on using it.

f01-058-02.png
and your own teacher. You will then be

f01-058-05.png
"mind" has given rise to endless

f01-058-06.png
controversy among philosophers and psycho-

f01-058-00.png
Thus learning how to learn means becoming

f01-058-04.png
will be at your feet. Although the word

f01-058-01.png
your own philosopher, your own psychologist

f01-058-08.png
abolish it from the dictionary, most

f01-075-08.png
for basic units of mind has gone on and will

f01-075-04.png
experiences by analogy with the way atoms of

f01-075-07.png
was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search

f01-075-01.png
be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were

f01-075-00.png
At one time it was thought that mind could indeed

f01-075-03.png
thought to combine together to form compound

f01-075-06.png
But this view led to too many difficulties and

f01-075-10.png
discover ultimate units.

f01-075-09.png
doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to

f01-075-02.png
identified as elementary sensations. These were

f01-075-05.png
matter combine to form molecular compounds.

f01-147-04.png
correspond with anything in his own experience. We know

f01-147-06.png
provide our schemas, nor do we need to know as far as

f01-147-03.png
all kinds of processes in other people, whether or not they

f01-147-02.png
to be prepared to observe and make inferences about

f01-147-00.png
He may never have had the disease himself but he

f01-147-08.png
the neuro-physiologists.

f01-147-01.png
can nevertheless identify it. Similarly the psychologist has

f01-147-07.png
psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of

f01-147-05.png
very little about the patterns of brain-activity which

f01-066-03.png
surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very

f01-066-09.png
are clearly associated with the brain.

f01-066-00.png
And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of

f01-066-06.png
essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from

f01-066-02.png
to detach the mind from the brain, and all the biological,

f01-066-04.png
close connection. There is a lot to be said for keeping the

f01-066-01.png
"mind" vanishes, at any rate for some time. It seems very difficult

f01-066-07.png
the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word "mind" for

f01-066-08.png
the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which

f01-066-05.png
word "soul" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable

f01-081-06.png
geometry.

f01-081-04.png
units of geometry must be points. It would be more

f01-081-03.png
in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate

f01-081-01.png
close analogy between the units of quite different

f01-081-02.png
sciences. For example the success of the atomic theory

f01-081-05.png
correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of

f01-081-00.png
We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any

f01-135-02.png
psychologist I am constantly

f01-135-05.png
They think there is something

f01-135-07.png
and this feeling of queerness

f01-135-01.png
the wrong way round. As a

f01-135-06.png
inevitably "queer" about psychology

f01-135-03.png
encountering this tendency

f01-135-00.png
It is the tendency to get things

f01-135-08.png
usually boils down to a quite

in friends and acquaintances.

f01-135-09.png
mistaken belief that the

nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is

This is what I mean by "getting things the wrong way

f01-139-04.png
as it is called), is not entirely ruled out,

f01-139-06.png
one of the most unreliable methods of getting

For although looking inwards (or "introspecting"

find the answers.

f01-053-05.png
how to do this for himself, with the help

f01-053-00.png
The job of the teacher is to set the learner's

f01-053-02.png
so as to make it grow. He does not

The solitary learner has to find out

f01-053-06.png
of books. He uses his vocabulary to

f01-053-01.png
vocabulary to work on the existing store

f01-085-06.png
but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction.

f01-085-00.png
There have been many conflicting tendencies in

f01-085-01.png
psychology in its search for ultimate units and here

f01-085-02.png
we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising

f01-085-04.png
It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it

f01-085-03.png
concept which is current today. It is known as the schema.

Providing this is sound, some perfectly good

installation of a power tool. As an elementary

e02-082-02.png
are not only an economic necessity, but that a

e02-082-05.png
example, surely no one can pretend to enjoy

e02-082-06.png
ripping out parts from hardwood. Most men

e02-082-00.png
This last point is certainly important because almost

e02-082-03.png
great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the

would unhesitatingly use a machine if it

e02-082-08.png
were available.

e02-082-01.png
everyone has come to recognise that machines

e02-014-05.png
of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces

e02-014-03.png
as before. It is unnecessary to mark the taper with

e02-014-02.png
on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated

e02-014-01.png
The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers

e02-014-00.png
For short ones a smoothing plane can be used.

e02-014-04.png
the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth

e02-014-06.png
straight.

e02-021-05.png
the outer surfaces being vertical as

e02-021-04.png
the taper on the two inner faces only,

e02-021-07.png
that at (D), Fig. 1, the square is first

Incidentally, it is better to

e02-021-03.png
begun. Some plain tapered legs have

e02-021-02.png
needed at the top before the tapering is

e02-021-01.png
complete any mortising that may be

e02-021-06.png
at (B), Fig. 1. To make a leg such as

the fuller kit (which in its turn, of course,

e02-091-01.png
with a good basic kit, which includes

As a still further development, we follow

e02-091-04.png
With this the vast majority of jobs

it enables results to be obtained fairly

to work with; and, although it does

e02-074-06.png
quickly; it is less expensive than most

e02-074-01.png
are many reasons. Wood is in good and

e02-074-00.png
But why woodwork in particular? Well, there

e02-074-10.png
all clean and easily cleared away.

e02-074-03.png
innumerable useful household items -

e02-074-02.png
common supply; it lends itself to making

create a certain amount of mess, it is

e02-074-04.png
furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.;

e02-094-02.png
depend partly upon the space available

e02-094-04.png
is prepared to pay, and the type of

e02-094-03.png
in the workshop, the amount one

e02-094-05.png
work a man normally does. First,

e02-094-08.png
machines. They never are cheap in the

e02-094-00.png
Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and

e02-094-01.png
machines, the choice of which will

e02-094-09.png
long run. They may be inaccurate,

e02-094-07.png
Do not buy so-called cheap tools or

e02-094-06.png
however, a word of advice generally.

e02-100-05.png
yourself to blame the tools when the job does

e02-100-02.png
better to pay the fair price for a tool of good

e02-100-00.png
Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults

e02-100-03.png
quality, and not handicap yourself from the start.

e02-100-04.png
To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow

e02-100-06.png
not turn out quite right!

e02-100-01.png
in design or quality soon become apparent. It is far

e02-025-09.png
exactly down to the taper line,

e02-025-06.png
with pencil and straight-edge

e02-025-03.png
tent of the taper, and in

e02-025-05.png
mark in the line of the taper

e02-025-01.png
the top member of the toe are

e02-025-10.png
no farther.

e02-025-04.png
this case it is necessary to

e02-025-08.png
made at the upper toe line

e02-025-02.png
needed as well as the upper ex-

e02-025-00.png
Note that squared lines marking

e02-025-07.png
as at (B), Fig. 3. A saw cut is

e02-018-02.png
has been removed, and if care is taken

e02-018-01.png
end reveals when the required amount

e02-018-05.png
accurate. The straight-edge can be used

e02-018-00.png
A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom

e02-018-06.png
to test the straightness of the sides.

e02-018-04.png
pencil line at the top, the work will be

e02-018-03.png
to stop the plane short of the squared

e02-086-06.png
nature of the work will probably dictate the additions

e02-086-00.png
Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin

e02-086-07.png
to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit

e02-086-02.png
most men have some of the tools already. It will enable

e02-086-01.png
with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably

e02-086-08.png
which increases the range of things that can be

e02-086-09.png
made enormously.

e02-086-05.png
which other tools can be added as the need arises. The

e02-086-03.png
a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in

e02-086-04.png
any case may be regarded as a good beginning to

e02-000-04.png
simply planed to give the required taper. In

e02-000-02.png
are frequently used. The simpler varieties are

e02-000-01.png
legs, and in reproduction period pieces they

e02-000-05.png
the more elaborate varieties, however, a toe is

e02-000-06.png
worked in the solid, and this certainly

e02-000-03.png
extremely easy to work, the four sides being

e02-000-07.png
complicates the operation.

e02-000-00.png
A great deal of modern furniture has tapered

d06-030-03.png
amount of rest seems to make any difference. Sleep, to be

d06-030-02.png
partly true. Many people wake up tired of a morning and no

d06-030-04.png
effective, must be of that child-like quality which comes

d06-030-01.png
purely physical thing. The cure for which is sleep. This is only

d06-030-05.png
from innocence.

d06-030-00.png
Amen. MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a

d06-050-04.png
disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense

d06-050-05.png
of fatigue. They wonder why they get no rest at night,

d06-050-02.png
attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do

d06-050-01.png
until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an

d06-050-00.png
Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired

d06-050-03.png
with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A

d06-050-06.png
even if they do sleep.

d06-091-10.png
we start by putting us into a strait-jacket

d06-091-05.png
meals everybody knows beforehand

d06-091-01.png
routine destroys the soul. It is so easy,

d06-091-03.png
from the school curriculum and even

d06-091-00.png
There may be some who will argue that

d06-091-04.png
worse the school system whereby for

d06-091-07.png
week, they are going to have. If - such

d06-091-09.png
us to adventure, do not strangle us before

d06-091-06.png
exactly what, on any given day of the

d06-091-08.png
a critic may say - you are calling

d06-091-02.png
they say, to get into a rut. Save us

d06-082-03.png
become too pernickety. Nevertheless, we could all probably

d06-082-01.png
we lose this way in the course of a day we would be

d06-082-00.png
If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -

d06-082-05.png
through.

d06-082-04.png
be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle

d06-082-02.png
staggered. Some of it is inevitable, and we do not want to

d06-015-02.png
proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look

d06-015-05.png
on.

d06-015-01.png
too many details, would help many a child to make a

d06-015-04.png
There are several instances where he seemed unable to go

d06-015-00.png
A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into

d06-015-03.png
at Jesus. We do not, I think, see there a life without fear.

d06-000-07.png
up either for the sham it is - and many

d06-000-04.png
to help them to face whatever it is that

d06-000-03.png
to pull themselves together. Far better

d06-000-06.png
cause and then deal with it; show it

of use telling even children, as I have

d06-000-09.png
irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
